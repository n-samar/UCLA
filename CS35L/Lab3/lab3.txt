1. I downloaded the coreutils localy and sent it to the lnxsrv using scp.

2. Extracting Coreutils file:
	   tar -xvzf core*

	   Configure & make:
	   	     cd core*
		     ./configure --prefix=$HOME/Desktop/testCore
		     make
		     make install

3. Set locale:
	LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
   Recreate bug (from Desktop):
	./testCore/bin/ls -l

4. Patching: I created a file named patchfile in emacs within the same file as
	  coreutils' ls. Then I ran within testCore/bin/
	  patch  < patchfile

5. Running the make command creates the following output:
   	    CC     dd.o
	    CCLD   dd
  	    CC     ls.o
  	    CCLD   dir
  	    CCLD   vdir
  	    CCLD   ls
   Also, this batch is outputed:
   	    GEN    dir.1
  	    GEN    vdir.1
  	    GEN    ls.1
   I assume this output specifies which files are recompiled. Clearly a new
   object file for ls has to be created (CCLD ls) and linked (CC ls.o). I
   assume dd, dir, and vdir depend on ls implementation, which is why they
   also have to be recompiled.
   
6. When running make install we do this:
   	make install DESTDIR=$HOME/Desktop/testCore2
   in order not to override the previos installation (in testCore).
   Within the home directory we can test the patch:
	  ./Desktop/testCore2/bin/ls -l
   We see then that output is properly formated.
   To test the output on year-old files we will use
      	   touch -d '1 May 2005 10:22' file1
   which will mark file1 as last modified in 2005. The output is of the form:
   	   -rw-r--r--  1 nikola csugrad   0 May  1  2005 file1
   Files modified this year are displayed as
           -rw-r--r-- 1 nikola csugrad    0 Jan 24 12:00 license
   Therefore, files modified more than a year ago will have the year in place of the
   minute and hour of their last modification.
