  take care of later.

- I entered these files and done vc-revert on them.

- For the .c files we need to go through them using first vc-diff (C-x v =).
- Then we need to revert all the hunks in .c files that aren't the character
  string constants (using C-u C-c C-a).

- The two .c files are:
	modified:   src/diff.c
	modified:   src/sdiff.c

- We go through them. Some changes are related to changing ` into ' inside comments
  In order to make our patch easy to audit we will remove these changes (C-u C-c C-a)
  since they do not change the performance of the program.

- I see a couple ./*.c.rej files. I use emacs

    	emacs src/diff.c.rej src/diff.c

- Compare the files and change all the non-comment grave accents by looking
through the .rej file

- I also had to modify one line in src/diff3.c because there was a .rej file
  associated to it

- Removing untracked files:

  	   git clean -f

- Create patch:

  	 git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt

- On lnxsrv07 I ran followed instruction to make diff and rand

	./src/diff . -

from the diffutils directory. The output was

	./src/diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory

which is good!

- There are differences but they are innocuous. SEAS netâ€™s diff displays only a 
	limited number of chars per line while mine displays to whole line.
	That is the only difference I noticed.
