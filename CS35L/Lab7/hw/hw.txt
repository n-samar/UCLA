ASSIGNMENT 7 - HOMEWORK:

1) The whole point of SSH is to prevent people tapping data by reading it
'in the middle'. All data between the two endpoints will be encrypted and
wouldn't be interpretable without the keys.

   Tapping the keyboard would be problematic since the enemy would be able
to pick up passwords that we used when creating the keys using ssh-keygen.
However, if the keyboard was tapped after we created the ssh keys, then
our information could be saved since we never type our private/public keys
through the keyboard, and we don't even type our passwords for the accounts
since we are using ssh-agent.

   Physical control of the USB wouldn't compromise any data since the USB
would only contain a .iso file used to boot Ubuntu. However, if we were to
everything that we saved onto the USB would be compromised, ofcourse. Saving
our keys to the USB therefore would not be smart. Also, there are probably
ways to introduce viruses or other malware into the computer through the USB
that would increase enemy's control of the computer, but I do not know
anything about how that works and it is probably beyond the scope of the
assignment.
