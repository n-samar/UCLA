LAB LOG:

My team and I booted Ubuntu from the disk provided in class and connected
to the same local network.
Installing OpenSSH:

    sudo apt-get install openssh-server
    sudo apt-get install openssh-client

This will install all the components necessary for us to run OpenSSH for this
assignment.

Now, let's set up the server:

We run

    ssh-keygen

to generate the public/private keys we will use. Since this is an excercise,
I didn't add a password (just pressed enter) and put the keys in the default
directory (/home/nikola/.ssh/id_rsa).

Then we used ifconfig to find our ip addresses. This will be the IP address
starting with 10. under the first inet addr.

Now, I add accounts that my teammates will login to:

sudo useradd -d /home/ryan -m ryan
sudo passwd ryan

(Change password to cs35l)

sudo mkdir /home/ryan/.ssh
cd /home/ryan
sudo chown -R ryan .ssh
sydo chmod 700 .ssh

And same for Priyanka, but using the usernama priyanka. These last 4 lines
create a .ssh directory for each of my teammates, give them the ownership
over this directory (chown), and I also give permission
for them to write on them (chmod 700).

Now the server is set up and I describe what to do as client. I will explain
only how I logged into ryan's server, since the steps for Priyanka were
analougus:

In order to access my account on Ryan's computer I need to send my public key
to it:

   ssh-copy-id -i nikola@<partner's IP>

Ryan set up the password for my account: cs35l. I use it when prompted.

Then I enter

ssh-add

in order to provide my private key to the ssh-agent. Now I can SSH into Ryan's
computer using the '-X' option to allow for port forwarding (this allows us to
use xterm). Now when I log in with

ssh -X nikola@<partner's IP>

and then type xterm we see a shell window on the host machine.

ISSUES WE ENCOUNTERED:

- We tried using VirtualBox, this ended up not being very fruitful.
- We had to try using several IPs (since ifconfig outputed plenty). Eventually,
we realized which on to use.
