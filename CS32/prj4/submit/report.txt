MyMap:
	associate(): O(log N) where N is the number of elements inside MyMap
	find()	   : O(log N) where N is the number of elements inside MyMap

AttractionMapper:
	init(): O(S + A*W*log A) where S is the number of segments in the
	appropriate MapLoader's MyMap, A is the number of attractions within
	these segments and W is the average word length of the street names.
	getGeoCoord(): O(log A) where A is the number of attraction within
	MapLoader's MyMap's segments.

SegmentMapper:
	init(): O(S*K*log G + K*A*log G) where S is the total number of
	segments, K is the average number of segments associated with a
	particular geocoordinate (if complete graph than this starts
	being a relevant factor), A is the number of attracions and G is
	the total number of geocoordinates.
	getSegments(): O(log G + K), where K is the average number of
	segments associated with a particular Geocoord and G is the total
	number of GeoCoords.

Navigator:
	navigate(): O((N+A)*log (N+A)), where N is the total number of
	segments and A is the total number of attractions.
