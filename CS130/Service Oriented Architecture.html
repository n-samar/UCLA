A message interchange standard that supports the communication between services.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Web Service Definition Language (WSDL)</span>. A standard for service interface definition. defines how the service operations and service bindings should be defined.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">WS-BPEL</span>. A standard for a workflow language that is used to define process programs involving several different services.</li></ul><li>Other standards that support SOA:</li><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">WS-Reliable Messaging</span>, a standard for message exchange</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">WS-Security</span>, set of standards supporting web service security including standards that specify the definition of security policies and standards that cover the use of digital signatures</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">WS-Adressing</span>, which standardizes SOAP message addressing</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">WS-Transactions</span>, defines how transactions across distributed services should be coordinated.</li></ul><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">RESTful services</span>. Simpler approach to service communication</li><li>Service based applications may be constructed by linking services from various providers using either a standard programming language or a specialized workflow language.</li><li>In comparison to CBSE, services do not have a requires interface and are implemented in full completely independently of the rest of the world.</li></ul><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Service Engineering</span></div><ul><li>The process of developing services for reuse in service-oriented applications</li><li>Three logical stages of the service engineering process:</li><ul><li>Service candidate identification</li><ul><li>Service should support business processes</li></ul><li>Service design</li><li>Service implementation and deployment</li></ul><li>Three types of services:</li><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Utility services</span>. Services that implement some general functionality that may be used by different business processes.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Business services</span>. Services associated with a specific business function</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Coordination or process services</span>. Services that involve a more general business process which usually involves different actors and activities. An example is an ordering service that allows orders to be placed with suppliers, goods accepted, and payments made.</li></ul><li>Another dichotomy of services:</li><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Task-Oriented</span>. Those associated with some activity</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Entity-Oriented</span>. Associated with a business entity.</li></ul><li>Questions to ask when determining whether a service is general/reusable</li><ul><li>For an entity oriented service, is the service associated with a single logical entity that is used in different business processes? What operations are normally performed no the entity?</li><li>For a task-oriented service, is the task one that is carried out by different people in the organization? Will they be willing to accept the inevitable standardization that occurs when a single support service is provided?</li><li>Is the service independent (i.e. how much does it rely on availability of other services)?</li><li>Does it have to maintain state? If state is required, database must be used which limits service reusability. Better have state passed by the client to the service.</li><li>Could the service be used by clients outside of the organization?</li><li>Could the service be used by clients outside of the organization?</li><li>Are different users likely to have different non-functional requirements?</li></ul></ul><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Service Interface Design</span></div><ul><li>Three stages of service interface design</li><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Logical interface design</span>, where you identify the operations associated with the service, their inputs and outputs and the exceptions associated with these ops.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Message design</span>, where you design the structure of the message that are send and received by the service</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">WSDL development</span>, where you translate your logical and message design to an abstract interface description written in WSDL.</li></ul><li>Defining responses to exceptions is very important for services. </li><li>Leave all exception handling to the user.</li></ul><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Service Implementation and Deployment</span></div><ul><li>Deployment involves making the service available for use on a web server.</li></ul><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Legacy System Services</span></div><ul><li>Legacy systems are old software systems that rely on obsolete technology, but are still essential to the business.</li><li>Implementing wrappers for legacy systems that provide access to a system’s functions and data is popular.</li></ul><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Software Development with Services</span></div><ul><li>Based on the idea that you compose and configure services to create new composite services.</li><li>Idea of <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">services market</span> where services are bought from external suppliers.</li><li>Design with reuse inevitably requires requirements compromises</li><li>Key stages in the process of services construction by composition</li><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Formulate outline workflow</span>.
