If the software has to be developed quickly, you should try to reuse off-the-shelf systems rather than individual components. </li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">The expected software lifetime</span>. If you are developing a long-lifetime system, you should focus on the maintainability of the system. Don’t just think of the immediate benefits of using ready-made components but also of the long-term implications.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">The background, skills, and experience of the development team</span>. </li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">The criticality of the software and its non-functional requirements</span>.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">The application domain</span>.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">The platform on which the system will run</span><span style="font-style: italic;">. </span></li></ul></ul><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Application frameworks</span></div><ul><li>Experience shows that object-oriented approach produces objects are too small of a unit for successful reuse on the class level.</li><li>Frameworks are an integrated set of software artifacts that collaborate to provide a reusable architecture for a family of related applications. Frameworks provide support for generic features that are likely to be used in all applications of a similar type.</li><li>Three classes of frameworks:</li><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">System infrastructure frameworks</span>. These frameworks support the development of system infrastructure such as communications, user interfaces, and compilers.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Middleware integration frameworks</span>. These consist of a set of standards and associated object classes that support component communication and information exchange.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Enterprise application frameworks</span>. These are concerned with specific application domains such as telecommunications or finance systems. These embed application domain knowledge and support the development of end-user applications.</li></ul><li>Features of web application frameworks:</li><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Security</span>. Web Application Frameworks may include classes to help implement user authentication (login) and access control to ensure that users can only access permitted functionality in the system</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Dynamic web pages</span>. Classes are provided to help you define web page templates and to populate these dynamically with specific data from the system database.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Database support</span>. The framework may provide classes that provide an abstract interface to different databases.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Session management</span>. Classes to create and manage sessions</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">User interaction</span>. AJAX support, which allows more interactive web pages to be created.</li></ul><li>To extend a framework you do not change the framework code. Rather, you add concrete classes that inherit operations from abstract classes in the framework. In addition, you may have to define callbacks. Callbacks are methods that are called in response to events recognized by the framework.</li><li>Frameworks are an effective approach to reuse, but are expensive to introduce into software development processes. </li><ul><li>They are inherently complex and it can take several months to learn to use them. </li><li>It may be hard to evaluate the quality of a framework</li><li>Debugging framework-based applications is difficult because the back-end method interactions may be hidden.</li></ul></ul><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Software product lines</span></div><ul><li>A software product line is a set of applications with a common architecture and shared components, with each application specialized to reflect different requirements.</li><li>Application frameworks vs. Software product lines</li><ul><li>Application frameworks rely on object-oriented features such as inheritance and polymorphism to implement extensions to the framework. Software product lines are not necessarily created using an object-oriented approach.</li><li>Application frameworks are primarily focused on providing technical rather than domain-specific support. A software product line usually embeds detailed domain and platform information.</li><li>Software product lines are often control applications for equipment. For example, there may be a software product line for a family of printers. Application frameworks are usually software-oriented and they rarely provide support for hardware interfacing.</li><li>Software product lines are made up of a family of related applications, owned by the same organization.</li></ul><li>Types of software product line specialization:</li><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Platform specialization</span>.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Environment specialization</span>.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Functional specialization</span>. Versions of application are created for specific customers who have different requirements.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Process specialization</span>. System is adapted to cope with specific business processes.</li></ul><li>System configuration may occur at different stages in the development process:</li><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Design-time configuration</span>. The organization developing the software modifies a common product line core by developing, selecting, or adapting components to create a new system for a customer</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Deployment-time configuration</span>. A generic system is designed for configuration by a customer or consultants working with the customer.</li></ul><li>Several levels of deployment-time configuration that may be provided in the system:</li><ul><li>Component selection, where you are free to select the modules in a system that provide the required functionality. </li><li>Workflow and rule definition, where you define workflows and validation rules that should apply to information entered by users or generated by the system.</li><li>Parameter definition, where you specify the values of specific system parameters that reflect the instance of the application you are creating.</li></ul></ul><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">COTS Product Reuse</span></div><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)</span> product is a software system that can be adapted to the needs of different customers without changing the source code of the system.</li><li>Very widely adopted by large companies, as it offers significant benefits over customized software development:</li><ul><li>more rapid deployment of a reliable system may be possible (as with other types of reuse)</li><li>It is possible to see what functionality is provided by the applications and so it is easier to judge whether or not they re likely to be suitable.</li><li>Some development risks are avoided by using existing software.</li><li>Business can focus more on their core activity without having to devote a lot of resource to IT systems development</li><li>As operating platforms evolve, technology updates may be simplified as these are the responsibility of COTS product vendor rather than the customer.</li></ul><li>Downsides of COTS:</li><ul><li>Requirements often have to be adapted to reflect the functionality and mode of operation of the COTS product.</li><li>The COTS product may be based on assumptions that are practically impossible to change.</li><li>Choosing the right COTS system for an enterprise can be a difficult process.</li><li>There may be a lack of local expertise to support systems development.</li><li>The COTS product vendor controls system support and evolution.</li></ul><li>Key features of architecture:</li><ul><li>A number of modules to support different business functions. These are large-grain modules that may support entire departments or division of the business.</li><li>A defined set of business processes, associated with each module, which relate to activities in that module.</li><li>A common database that maintains information about all related business functions.</li><li>A set of business rules that apply to all data in the database. For example, there may be a business rule that all expense claims have to be approved by someone more senior than the person making the claim.</li></ul><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">COTS-integrated systems</span> are applications that include two or more COTS products or, sometimes, legacy application systems.</li><li>Design choices that need to be made in order to develop systems using numerous COTS products:</li><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Which COTS products offer the most appropriate functionality?</span></li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">How will data be exchanged between different COTS products?</span></li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Which features of each product will actually be used?</span></li></ul><li>Downsides of COTS-integrated systems:</li><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Lack of control over functionality and performance</span>.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Problems with COTS system interoperability</span>. Each COTS product may  embed its own assumptions about how it will be used, and these need not be consistent with each other.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">No control over system evolution</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></li><li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Support from COTS vendors.</span></li></ul></ul><div><br/></div></body></html>
