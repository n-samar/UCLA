1 Gathering Instruction Traces
==============================

  1. Enter gdb with the executable gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-25.2
  2. Set breakpoint at Ftimes break Ftimes
  3. Set machine code output set disassemble-next-line on
  4. Set logging on so that gdb output is saved set logging on
  5. Run the appropriate command r -Q -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240
     -1844255039))'
  6. We reach the breakpoint set at Ftimes. Now we should step through
     the function until it returns. We notice that Ftimes also calls an
     arithmetic driver function. I also used info reg/print $<register>
     to examine the content of the registers throughout execution and 
     fill in the last column of the output.
