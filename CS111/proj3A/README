1 Description of included files
===============================

  - README: This README
  - lab3a.c: My implementation of Project 3A in C
  - Makefile: Includes directives as discribed in the project spec.


2 Testing
=========

  The spec suggests that we use the "0%o" format for the mode.  However,
  this is contradictory to the trivial.csv file.  I have decided to
  comply with trivial.csv because it is required that the output be
  identical to it.
