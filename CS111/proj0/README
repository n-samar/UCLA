Sanity Check:

I understand the program does not pass the sanity check, but it does pass every
one of the test cases! The final output of the sanity check is "FAILS sanity
check with 0~ errors!". Looking at each of the testcases, you can see that the
code passes them. I was unable to debug the issue that causes the error counter
in the sanity checker to get a tilde appended to it.

Smoke tests:
- OK_exit_code: checks that the exit code upon success is correct and that 
  the function succeds when it should.
- standard: tests that the input and output match when the function is 
  suppose to succed.
- input_redirect: checks that the --input flag works properly.
- output_redirect: checks that the --output flag works properly.
- segfault_test: checks that the segmentation fault is caught when both
  --segfault and --catch flags are activated.
- segflt: Checks that the error code is set to SIGSEGV when --segfault is set
  without --catch.
